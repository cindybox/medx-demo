          Compounding is the practice of preparing personalized or custom
          medications by mixing, combining or altering two or more chemicals to
          create a medication tailored to the need of an individual patient.
          This practice dates back to the origins of pharmacy, but compounding’s
          presence in the pharmacy profession has evolved throughout the years.
          Within the last three decades, compounding has experienced a comeback,
          as modern technology, innovated techniques and research have allowed
          more pharmacist to customize medication to meet specific patient
          needs. <br />

          meant that some patients needs were not being met. There are several
